Designed and developed a visually appealing website for the Dallas Mavericks using React, showcasing Roster and Players Card pages. 

Although it is the Miami Heat, this was the project that was given by the Dallas Mavericks

Utilized Figma for website design

The Roster page displays all active players with name, number, position, height, weight, and college. Clicking a player navigates to a Player Card with expanded details including career stats and highlights. 

The result is an interactive, informative Mavs site showcasing players in a bold, stylish way for fans.
